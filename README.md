## Inventory Optimization Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Efficient inventory management is essential for businesses aiming to reduce holding costs, prevent stockouts, and optimize their operations. This project employs advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze and forecast inventory needs using datasets comprising purchase prices, sales transactions, inventory levels, and supplier information. By calculating and applying inventory-specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR), Safety Stock, and Reorder Points (ROP), this project offers data-driven solutions to maintain optimal stock levels and improve supplier coordination.



## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to integrate advanced computational techniques to provide actionable insights into inventory management. The analysis includes:

Data Integration: Combining multiple datasets (e.g., purchases, sales, inventory levels) to create a unified view of inventory behavior.

KPI Calculation: Leveraging industry-standard metrics to assess inventory performance.

Demand Forecasting: Predicting future demand using deep learning models such as LSTM for accurate stock adjustments.

Optimization: Implementing replenishment strategies to minimize costs while maintaining service levels.

### Key KPIs and Formulas

Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR)
Measures how efficiently inventory is used over a specific period:

Safety Stock (SS)
Ensures protection against demand variability during lead time.

Reorder Point (ROP)
The inventory level at which a new order should be placed:

Holding Cost (HC)
Reflects the cost of storing unsold inventory:


## Demand Forecasting with Deep Learning
Using historical sales data, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was trained to forecast future demand. The model captures temporal dependencies, seasonality, and trends, offering a robust prediction framework. The pipeline includes:

Data Preprocessing: Time series normalization and handling missing values.
Model Architecture: A multi-layer LSTM network with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation Metrics: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts.
